  ### My thoughts about nursing in Ireland. 


  Here you can find useful information such as nursing registration, salaries, adaptation tests & Aptitude tests etc..


  All nurses and midwives who practice in Ireland must by law be listed on the Register of Nurses and Midwives which is maintained by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). 


  Currently around 65,000 nurses and midwives who are practicing in Ireland are included on the Register.
