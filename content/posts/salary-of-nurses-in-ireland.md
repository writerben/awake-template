## Salary of Nurses in Ireland


This blog explores the salary of nurses in Ireland. This also focuses on average take-home pay after tax.

### Salary of Pre-registered Nurses and Adaptation (candidate) nurses


A newly qualified staff nurse or midwife, that is a nurse who has finished college, but has yet to be registered under the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), would start on an annual salary of around ***€25,666***
This is the same case with nurses doing the adaptation. Overseas nurses doing adaptation is considered as pre-reg nurses or as candidate nurses in public hospital and they are also given the above salary.

After-tax, that amounts to around ***€21,700***, or a net monthly income of around €1,800. If it is broken to weekly wages, that is in the region of €11.50 per hour after tax.

However, pre-reg nurses will move on to the registered nurses salary scale once they have NMBI PIN number.  



### Salary of Registered Staff Nurses in Ireland


A registered staff nurse’s salary in Ireland starts at €30,009. After-tax, it will be around €25,434 per year, or €2,119 per month, or around €489 per week. For a 39-hour working week, a nurse at the bottom of the ladder would be getting around €14.79 per hour after tax.


The above is the first point of the scale in the salary of nurses in Ireland. This scale can reach a high of €45,119 & 46,501 in yearly increments (after 10 years).

Please note, the above figures are indicative. If you are working for HSE, there will be more taken from your pay (for pension). For someone earning 36.5 K, average pension deduction will be € 145 per month.

Nurses who come from overseas with experience will be placed on to the correct scale once they finish adaptation.

For example, A nurse with 5-year experience when coming to Ireland they earn €24,850/year during their adaptation. However, when they get their NMBI PIN, they will be on the 5th scale of pay. ie € 35487.

### 
Enhance Practice Scale


There was a nursing strike in 2019 to improve pay conditions for Nurses. To put it in a nutshell, there was couple of changes to nurses pay. 

1. Nurses on 4th point of scale get an option to move on to the first point of enhanced practice contract. The salary start from **€36,433** and reach up to **€46 643** ( 8 scales) 


2. Expansion of Location Qualification Allowance ( Annual) to other areas

   * €2230 for working in medical and surgical areas
   * € 3349 for having a specialist qualification such as higher diploma or masters and working in specialist area.


In an essence, most of the nurses would be eligible to get either one of this. Both of these allowances will not be given simultaneously. You get the higher one. 

###
