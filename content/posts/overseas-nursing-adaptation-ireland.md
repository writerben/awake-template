### Overseas nursing adaptation Ireland. What is it?



It is an intense 6-week program to get yourself adapted to the Irish health care system. Upon your start, you will be given a Corporate Induction by the hospital. Usually  from the second week onward you start your journey of completing the adaptation. A preceptor will be assigned to you. You as an adaptation candidate is expected to work under your scope of practice and at the same time to adapt to the Irish health care system. 

Each week, you will have to meet certain criteria. You will have an initial meeting, intermediate meeting and a final meeting as a part of adaptation. On week 6 of your adaption, you are expected to handle the full caseload as an Independent Practitioner. You should be able to priorities, organise and deliver the planned care to all your patients.

The purpose of the period of adaptation and assessment is to ensure that each candidate nurse becomes eligible for registration with NMBI. In order to become eligible for registration, the candidate nurse must achieve competence. Competence is demonstrated by the ability of the candidate nurse to practise safely and effectively, fulfilling their professional responsibility within their scope of practice. The candidate nurse works under the responsibility of a qualified nurse to develop and demonstrate the expected competencies within their scope of practice for the duration of the period of adaptation.

The candidate nurse actively engages in the process of adaptation, and has a responsibility to negotiate opportunities given to them to make up the shortfall in training required for recognition of registration with NMBI. The period of adaptation is the subject of an assessment to determine the achievement of competence. The Director of Nursing will attest to the suitability of the candidate nurse to have their name entered on the Register as maintained by NMBI following this period of adaptation and assessment.

### How will I get a place for nursing adaptation and how can I perform better during adaptation?

I have to say, there is no easy way to get a place for adaptation! The best way to get your adaptation placement is to find a suitable employer. If you have the required experience and expertise within the field, you might be called for an Interview. Once you clear your interview and get a job offer, then you have secured your adaptation.

In most cases your employer will assist with your relocation including VISA process. In most cases, you don’t have to pay a penny.

### Outcome of adaptation

* You pass the adaptation: Congratulations, you cleared it, now embrace it and be a proud nurse!
* Extension: You might get an extension, where preceptor is not happy with your performance as an Independent Practitioner. If you have not done anything unsafe and out of your scope of practice, you might get another few weeks to clear the adaptation. If you belong to this group, tighten your belt and be focused and improve on what you are doing.
* Fail: You have not met the criteria to pass adaptation and to practice as an Independent Practitioner.
  Whats Next?

If you have passed, you wait for your NMBI PIN, until you get that, your scope of practice will be limited as that of adaptation candidate.

If you have failed, you could possibly appeal it. But if you don’t have any strong supporting documents to back it up, the decision might not get changed.



### how can I be best prepared for Adaptation?

The principal aim of the period of adaptation is to harness the knowledge and expertise that the candidate nurse has previously acquired, to make up shortfalls in previous training, and relay content that is specific to the State. The candidate nurse should be empowered to accept and exercise responsibility and accountability for independent learning, personal growth and self-awareness. It will also enable them to demonstrate the competence required to have their name entered on the Register.
