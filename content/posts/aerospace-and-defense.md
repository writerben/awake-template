## How can I become a nurse in Ireland (Made for overseas trained nurses)

Yes, you came here looking for information. Information pertaining to nursing registration and finding a job in Ireland.

**If you belong to this category you can read on.**

I am trying to write down all the information as simple as possible, all in one place.

**The first and foremost step is to get your Nursing registration with NMBI.**  Detailed information about the same available from NMBI.

But I know, you might be looking for a simpler version of this document. Let’s break it even further.

Towards your NMBI registration.

A. Get your English Language requirement sorted!

There are three categories of applicants.

Group -1 & 2: Nurses rained as a general nurse or midwife in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA)

\
Group 3- Nurses trained outside the EU.

No matter what group you belong to, From 2 April 2018, applicants for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland who have qualifications from outside of Ireland must now satisfy the Board that they have the necessary knowledge of English to communicate effectively in their practice.

Any applicants who completed their preregistration course or who have practised as an RN in the following country does not need to write an English Language exam.

* Australia
* Canada
* New Zealand 
* The United States of America
* United Kingdom

So in a Nutshell, if you have not trained or worked as an RN in any of the above countries, you will need to write an English Language Test.

### An important point to remember

Do not apply for registration until you meet the minimum scores under the IELTS Academic Test/OET . If you make an application and don’t meet the English language competency requirements, the assessment fee is non-refundable

### Get your Application pack from NMBI

Now that you have met the language competency, the next step is to apply for an initial registration pack. Visit  NMBI to get your Overseas Registration Application Request Form.

This form requires you to provide:

* Personal contact details
* Division(s) of the Register
* Your TRF number, for Group 3 applicants only
* Details of your Debit/Credit Card so that the assessment fee may be deducted 

### Overseas Registration Application Pack

Once the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) processes your Overseas Registration Application Request Form and the assessment fee, you will be issued with an Overseas Registration Application Pack. You need to read and follow all the instructions within this pack carefully to avoid unnecessary delays in processing your application. This is very important.

There are Mainly two sections in this application form.

* Section -1 needs to be completed by you, the applicant.
* Section-2 needs to completed by relevant authorities. 

For detailed information click here.

At this, you will receive how to create your account with NMBI web. This will enable to track the progress of the application.

**The key thing to do** – Get all your papers ready as fast as you can. NMBI works on the papers on first come first serve basis, and they will not start an assessment untill all your papers are in. 

Assessment and Outcome

Once all your papers are in, then NMBI will assess and will give you an outcome within 90 days. The decision could be

1. You get your PIN (Extreme rare for Non-EU trained cases, But there is one case I know, where she got direct PIN)
2. Do and adaptation or Aptitude test to complete registration.

## Adaptation or Aptitude

   The next big step is to find an employer who is willing to give you a job to complete adaptation or to write an aptitude test conducted by RCSI. 

### What’s Next?

The best thing to do is to find an employer who gives you a job to facilitate adaptation. 

Please note- In Ireland no employer should charge money from any candidates.  No one. In fact HSE and all Hospitals pay agencies t get a nurse.  

**You have a few options.** 

#### Option- 1 : Contact hospitals directly. 

Check out their career pages and send in your CV. You can find jobs at the following websites

* [HSE](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/jobs/job-search/) - Ireland's national public hospital network

##### Voluntary hospital (Funded by HSE, but managed by independant board)

* [St James's Hospital](http://www.stjames.ie/Careers/)
* [St Vincent's Hospital](https://www.stvincents.ie/careers/)
* [Beaumont Hospital](http://www.beaumont.ie/vacancies)
* [Mater Hospital](https://www.mater.ie/healthcare-professionals/job-opportunities/)

##### Private Hospitals

* [Beacon Hospital](https://www.beaconhospital.ie/careers/)
* [Black Rock Clinic](https://www.blackrock-clinic.ie/about-blackrock-clinic/careers/)
* [Bon Secours Hospital](https://www.bonsecours.ie/careers)



#### Option 2: Contact HSE preffered agencies

These agencies are given a contract by HSE to recruit nurses. They will not charge a penny from you. They will pay your ticket, travele expenses and even will sort your initial accomodation.

There are around 5 agencies, but it goes like that.  HSE have a principal agency, if they are not able to supply nurses, the preference goes to the second agency, and then third so on. 

Mostly the first agency will be able to meet service demands. 

[CPL](https://cplhealthcare.com/nursing-jobs/) is one of the agencey

[KCR](https://kcr.ie/) is in the business for decaded and proved to be a leading agency. They usully come to India through their partner IITR (Delhi) and recruit nurses free of charge. 

### Option 3: Contact nursing homes

There are 100's of nursing homes across the country. Just google and find out their websites, contact them directly either through career page or email.  Some of the nursing home will bring you here and even pay for your aptitude test.

# Do not pay any penny  to any  illegal agents

Please be aware that there are numerous so called agents who might promise you a job and ask money in return. They operate illegally. Legally no one can charge any candidate. If you come through them you might get terrible accomodation, treatment and even salary. As far as I am aware these agents even claim that they can fast track NMBI application. That is unheard of. Nobody can do it. 

Please be vigilent. 

#### Option 4: Take an atypical Visa

You could apply for an Atypical VISA and come to Ireland to do your Aptitude test. once you complete your aptitude test, it should be fairly easy to find a job.
