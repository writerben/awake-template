## The state of Aerospace and Defense

As part of a critical infrastructure industry, aerospace and defense leaders must respond to the immediate crisis now while also planning for new ways of working which will emerge as COVID-19 infection cases begin to decline in the coming months.

Airlines are cutting immediate capacity in the range of 40 to 100 percent and asking for deferrals, model switches and cancellations on orders. Most major civil aircraft assembly plants are closed indefinitely or operating at a vastly reduced volume. These lower production rates are rippling down to the supplier network as production is paused and workforces furloughed.

While airlines still need to maintain parked aircraft, aftermarket revenues will be severely curtailed as overhauls are deferred to conserve cash and the maintenance mainstay hourly contracts track schedule and capacity downwards. As airlines make decisions on retiring models and reassess their fleet needs, aircraft production and aftermarket services will need to be fundamentally reassessed to account for long-term demand shifts.

Defense markets – and their dependent supply networks — remain strong from a demand perspective, with governments easing procurement processes and offering better payment terms. Even though deemed as a critical infrastructure industry status in many countries, defense contractors across the globe are facing lockdowns. However, the ability to maintain program schedules and production rates are hampered by the dual challenges of managing a highly skilled but now remote workforce while ensuring the safety of on-site workers. While most defense production sites are operational, local conditions are causing closures across the globe.

## How to manage now

Aerospace and defense companies almost by definition solve large, audacious challenges. But now, business leaders must make rapid decisions and take immediate actions to protect the health and safety their people — including in their workplaces — while ensuring that critical business operations continue. They must also reassess fundamental shifts in medium term demand.

## Response governance - containing the chaos

A critical action to successfully navigate the ongoing COVID-19 turbulence is to create a rapid response infrastructure with clear ownership of crisis monitoring and tracking. This infrastructure should communicate important and ever-changing information to senior decision makers and integrate tools to develop and execute response protocols, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and data science.
