## RCSI Aptitude test practical Training

Dear readers,

After much thought and considerable thinking, I have decided to help future RCSI test takers to navigate through the aptitude test.

***Disclosure:*** This service is not an official RCSI training, nor do I claim that I will cover all parts of the test. The whole purpose of this training is to equip experienced nurses to face the exam.

This will be whole day training, morning to evening, hosted at a convenient location in Dublin. We expect to launch soon once the COVID eases.  If you need more information or to be on the waiting list for the training shoot an email to training@vacancypool.com.

## What is Aptitude Test: Please read our previous blog Aptitude test

### Practical Test

RCSI uses an internationally acknowledged assessment objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) for their practical test. It’s a simulated practical setting which is known as a station.

Each station refers to a clinical setting and the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 14 stations and a maximum of 20 stations. Your competencies pertaining to general nursing will be assessed in each of these stations.

The whole purpose of the training is to alleviate any anxiety you are experiencing. I will not be adding anything significant to your knowledge base but could help you to translate your current knowledge to the Irish healthcare system. So it is mandatory for you to read all the relevant materials that are provided on the RCSI website as supporting reading materials.

NB: The mock scenarios are taken from the own experience of the author and other trainers to give you a taste of what could be expected. These scenarios may never be a part of the original tests
